  Planning a vacation can be stressful, especially on top of our busy lives.  Our goal here at <strong>Trailblazers</strong> is to put all the information at your fingertips, whether it is popular tourist landmarks, hidden gems, restaurants, hotels, or even helpful tips about the local culture.  We want to make it easy for you to travel because we believe <em>one can learn so much through seeing the world</em>.  In the wise words of Mark Twain, "Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime."  Our site has everything you need to know about the cities you want to travel to and more!
